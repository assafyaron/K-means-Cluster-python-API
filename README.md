Implementation of K Means Algorithm in Python using C-python API to optimize runtime.

Input: k, iter, epsilon, input1.txt, input2.txt

1. K represents the number of centroids s.t 1 < K < N = number of vectors.
2. iter dictates how many times to calculate new centroids. Default value is 300.
3. epsilon dictates the sufficent amount of preciseness we are looking for.
4. input1.txt & input2.txt should contain a single vector in each line, where coordinates are seperated by ",".
